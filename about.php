    	<h1>About Indy Graphics</h1>
    </div>
  <p>Over 25 years ago Indy Graphics was started with a vision to provide top quality print products all in one place.<br />The largest complaint heard in the market was having to source from so many different companies for all the different print needs.</p>
    <p>Indy Graphics identified the problem and created a one source approach for print needs, from Labels, decals, forms, brochures to metal plates, lamacoids and even promotional products we have partnered with top quality trade manufactures to provide anything that Indy Graphics does not complete in house.<br>
      Our volumes purchased over each year allow us to provide quality, price and service to our clients that makes your purchasing easier.</p>
